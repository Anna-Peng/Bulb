Exercise Details:

Member Referrals
The CEO has come to your desk and explained that we want to increase signups from our
referral scheme . As part of this effort, we are keen to understand at what point in the
member lifecycle members refer other people. There are 2 CSV files attached to your email
that contain information on our customers and their referral behaviour:
● The Customer Info CSV contains information on customers and metadata for each
customer. It is a representative sample of the whole customer database
● The Referral Info CSV is a log of sign-ups we have received from the referral
channel
Use this information to answer the questions below:
1. When do members refer?
(Try to think about each member lifetime, starting from when they sign-up to Bulb.
The number of Bulb members is growing very quickly. A lot of Bulb members have not been with
Bulb for very long. Think about how this might affect your conclusions.)
2. Does the channel members are acquired from significantly impact how they refer? Do
you think we need a larger sample size to be sure?
3. We can send an email to members to invite them to refer their friends. We can choose
when, and to whom, we send the emails. How would you suggest we proceed?
You should aim to spend 2-3 hours on this task. If
